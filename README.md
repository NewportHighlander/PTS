PTS (aka The Currency Formerly Known As Bitshares-PTS)
======================================================

Originally invented as a means to create a fair initial distribution for the
[BitShares (BTS) DAC](https://dacsunlimited.com/), PTS has matured and is now a
currency on its own. The [objectives and core values](http://pts.cubeconnex.com/index.php?topic=9.0)
of the new PTS are

* simplicity - PTS is delegated proof of stake (DPOS). It is a pure
  implementation of the core DPOS protocol without the application-specific
  functionality of the many profitable DACs that will be built on top of it. In
  this way, PTS is the foundation layer of the BitShares ecosystem.

* openness - PTS is not only open-source, but also open strategy. PTS
  promotes open development and contribution to the BitShares platform by third
  party developers and investors. At the same time, PTS is agnostic to the
  features, technology, and business strategy of any particular DAC that is
  built on top of it. PTS is the Switzerland of DACs.

* collaboration - PTS will be built with extensibility and collaboration in
  mind. In addition to serving as the common core of profitable DACs, PTS will
  also serve as a launching pad and resource for developers of new DACs. In this
  way, any contribution to PTS is a contribution to the BitShares ecosystem. The
  mantra of PTS is: easy-to-use, easy-to-build, and easy-to-fork.

* stability - PTS is a stable, non-inflationary, and fairly distributed token.
  PTS is not a business and is not designed with the objective of maximizing
  profit. As the business environment changes, application-specific DACs will
  have to evolve to maintain their competitive advantage. PTS may also evolve,
  but only with a slow and steady hand that serves the interest of PTS holders
  and these core values.
